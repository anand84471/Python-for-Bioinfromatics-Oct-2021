# Q1. Write a program to find the second maximum GC value from the list also find the median GC value.
#     Gc values are as follows 30.5,12,54,23,84
# Q2. Write a program to check which stop codons are present in the sequence  â€œUAAAAGGCGAGAUAAAUAâ€.
# Q3. Check the presence of all the stop codons in the list ["UAA","UGC","AUAGCT","ATUA","UAG"] .
# Q4. Write a program to transcribe the sequence "ATGCTCGCGTAA"
# Q5. Concatenate two lists of GC Values [30.5,12,54,23,84] and [12,45,54,32] 
#     and find the maxium and minum GC Values.
